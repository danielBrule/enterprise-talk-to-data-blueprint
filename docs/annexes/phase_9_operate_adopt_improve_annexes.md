# 1 How to use this annex

These annexes provide optional working templates for Phase 9: Operate, adopt and improve. They are intended to help teams run a controlled T2D production release, monitor real usage, manage incidents, govern change, improve safely and prepare for longer-term lifecycle decisions.

The templates are not all mandatory. Teams should select the artefacts that match the release scope, risk level, user population, data sensitivity and operating maturity of the service.

For a narrow internal release, a lightweight operating cadence, issue log and change record may be sufficient. For a broader, decision-critical or regulated release, monitoring, feedback-to-trace analysis, governance, access lifecycle, regression evidence, cost review and retirement planning should be treated more formally.

The annexes should support operation, not create bureaucracy. If a template does not help the team run, control, improve or safely stop the service, it should be simplified or skipped.

|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Incorrect access enforcement                    | Pause affected users or scope immediately.               |
| Materially misleading answer in supported scope | Pause affected question type and investigate root cause. |
| Missing or broken audit trace                   | Pause affected flow until traceability is restored.      |

| Repeated unsupported use                        | Update guidance, constrain scope or review adoption.     |
| Upstream semantic change without T2D review     | Pause affected metric until retested.                    |
| Model or prompt change degrades behaviour       | Roll back to previous approved version.                  |

## 2.6 Transition to stable operation criteria

| Criterion       | Stable-operation expectation                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Usage           | Usage pattern is understood and within expected scope.         |
| Incidents       | No unresolved blocking or recurring material incidents.        |
| Support         | Support route works without exceptional project-team effort.   |
| Access          | Onboarding, offboarding and role changes are controlled.       |
| Quality         | Answer-quality issues are visible, triaged and owned.          |
| Cost            | Cost and latency are understood and within agreed tolerance.   |
| Governance      | Change, risk and boundary decisions have an active forum.      |
| Upstream change | Upstream owners are engaged and material changes are reviewed. |

## 2.7 First operating review agenda

- Review usage, incidents, cost, latency and support signals.

- Review unsupported questions and user feedback.

- Review answer-quality or trust concerns.

- Review access changes and exceptions.

- Review upstream data, semantic, metadata, access or platform changes.

- Confirm fixes, constraints, communications or escalations required.

- Confirm whether early-life support remains adequate.

- Update issue log, decision log and next review actions.

## 2.8 Common mistakes to avoid

| Mistake                                            | Why it matters                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assuming release approval means operation is ready | Phase 9 must test whether the operating model works in real use.       |
| Leaving support with the build team informally     | This hides the true operating cost and support model.                  |
| Reviewing usage without quality, trust or cost     | High usage can still create risk or unsustainable cost.                |
| Ignoring upstream changes                          | T2D behaviour can change even when the application has not changed.    |
| No pause or rollback owner                         | The team may be unable to act quickly when trust or access is at risk. |
| Treating early-life support as permanent           | The service should transition to stable operation or be redesigned.    |

## 2.9 Evidence to retain

- Operating start checklist.

- Early-life support plan.

- Named owner and escalation route.

- Monitoring dashboard or signal extract.

- Early-life issue and decision log.

- Upstream change review notes.

- Pause, rollback or narrowing decisions.

- First operating review minutes.

- Stable-operation transition decision.

# 3 Activity 2: Monitor production usage, quality, trust, reliability and cost

## 3.1 Production monitoring view

Purpose: define the minimum monitoring view needed to operate the live T2D service.

| Area        | Signals to review                                          | Owner                      | Review cadence        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Usage       | Active users, question volume, follow-up depth, peak usage | Product / operating owner  | Weekly                |
| Scope       | Supported, unsupported and ambiguous questions             | Product / semantic owner   | Weekly                |
| Quality     | Failed answers, weak grounding, missing caveats, refusals  | Product / evaluation owner | Weekly                |
| Trust       | Over-reliance, misunderstood caveats, inappropriate use    | Product / adoption owner   | Fortnightly / monthly |
| Reliability | Errors, timeouts, failed tool calls, availability          | Platform / AI owner        | Daily / weekly        |
| Cost        | Model calls, query execution, logging, support effort      | Product / platform owner   | Weekly / monthly      |
| Access      | Denied access, permission issues, exposure concerns        | Security / access owner    | Weekly                |

## 3.2 Monitoring threshold template

| Signal                    | Expected range | Review trigger | Action owner | Response                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Unsupported questions     |                |                |              | Update guidance / backlog / constrain scope |
| Failed answers            |                |                |              | Investigate and fix                         |
| High-latency interactions |                |                |              | Review routing, query or model pattern      |
| Cost per interaction      |                |                |              | Review model, query or follow-up behaviour  |
| Repeated rephrasing       |                |                |              | Review answer clarity or user guidance      |
| Access issue              |                |                |              | Escalate to access owner                    |
| Trust concern             |                |                |              | Follow up with user / review guidance       |

## 3.3 Unsupported-question log

| Date | User group | Question type | Example question | Reason unsupported                                                                      | Suggested route                                       |
|------|------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|      |            |               |                  | Data not ready / metric undefined / access issue / outside scope / higher-risk use case | Guidance / fix / improve / expand / separate use case |

Purpose: distinguish real demand from unsafe scope creep. Unsupported questions may reveal useful needs, but they should not automatically become part of the live T2D service.

## 3.4 Trust and interpretation check

Purpose: capture signals that are unlikely to appear clearly in logs.

| Check                                       | Evidence source                     | Concern found? | Action                             |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Do users understand caveats?                | Feedback / interview / support call |                | Update answer wording or guidance  |
| Are users over-trusting answers?            | User follow-up / workflow review    |                | Reinforce responsible-use guidance |
| Are outputs used outside intended workflow? | User discussion / support review    |                | Clarify usage boundary             |

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Is the issue caused by answer wording, prompt behaviour, clarification or UI guidance? | Likely T2D-layer fix.                              |
| Is the issue caused by data, modelling, metric definition, metadata or access rules?   | Likely upstream fix.                               |
| Is a temporary T2D constraint needed while upstream fix is pending?                    | Constrain, caveat, pause or refuse affected scope. |
| Does the fix change production behaviour?                                              | Trigger regression test and change record.         |

| Manual onboarding | Speed up early adoption | Access process not scalable |                      |       | Formalise / fix / remove |

Suggested rule: any shortcut must be visible, time-bound, owned and reviewed.

## 5.4 Boundary review checklist

| Check      | Question                                                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|

| Data       | Are only approved domains, assets, metrics and dimensions used? |
| Exports    | Are answers being reused only in approved workflows?            |
| Exceptions | Are temporary shortcuts still justified?                        |
| Drift      | Is repeated support creating informal scope expansion?          |

## 5.5 Evidence to retain

- Access lifecycle log.

- Approved user and role list.

- Boundary exception log.

- Temporary shortcut register.

- Access or exposure issue records.

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Freshness       | Source refreshed within expected window                  |           |       |             |
| Schema / format | Tables, columns and data types unchanged                 |           |       |             |
| Volume          | Row counts and volumes within expected range             |           |       |             |
| Quality         | Nulls, duplicates, completeness, reconciliation          |           |       |             |
| Access          | Row, column, masking and role rules still apply          |           |       |             |
| Metadata        | Required metric, dimension and caveat metadata available |           |       |             |

## 7.2 Upstream change impact checklist

Purpose: assess whether an upstream change affects live T2D behaviour.

| Change area             | Impact question                                           | Action                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Data source             | Does the change affect freshness, coverage or quality?    | No action / test / update / escalate |
| Data model              | Does the change affect grain, joins or aggregation?       | No action / test / update / escalate |
| Metric / semantic logic | Does the change affect meaning, filters or caveats?       | No action / test / update / escalate |
| Metadata                | Does the change affect retrieval, grounding or examples?  | No action / test / update / escalate |
| Access                  | Does the change affect visibility, refusal or exposure?   | No action / test / update / escalate |
| Reporting logic         | Does the change affect reconciliation to trusted outputs? | No action / test / update / escalate |

## 7.3 Currency update log

| Date | Asset / artefact                                            | Change | User impact                   | Owner | Status                        |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
|      | Metric / dimension / caveat / metadata / guidance / runbook |        | None / internal / user-facing |       | Open / updated / communicated |

## 7.4 Human review prompt

Purpose: capture judgement-based checks that automation will not reliably detect.

| Question                                                         | Review note |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Is the metric still business-appropriate?                        |             |
| Is the caveat still understandable to users?                     |             |
| Could users misinterpret the answer after this change?           |             |
| Does the anomaly reflect a real business movement or data issue? |             |
| Should user guidance or support material be updated?             |             |

## 7.5 User check-in guide

Purpose: validate interpretation and usefulness with users.

| Topic          | Question                                                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Caveats        | Are limitations clear when you read the answer?               |
| Trust          | Do you know when to rely on the answer and when to verify it? |
| Interpretation | Have any answers been confusing or misleading?                |
| Workflow       | Are you using outputs in the intended workflow?               |
| Gaps           | Are there repeated questions the service cannot answer?       |

This can be done through structured focus groups, but informal check-ins with representatives of key user groups are often enough.

## 7.6 BAU regression check trigger

| Trigger                             | Regression needed?                         |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Source schema, grain or join change | Usually yes                                |
| Metric, filter or caveat change     | Yes                                        |
| Metadata or example update          | Yes if retrieval or grounding may change   |
| Access-rule change                  | Yes                                        |
| Documentation-only wording change   | Only if user-facing interpretation changes |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Does the item belong in the current T2D service?                                        | Yes / No / unclear |
| Is it caused by upstream data, semantic, metadata, access or platform issue?            |                    |
| Does it require product, data, semantic, AI, platform, security or governance capacity? |                    |
| Is funding or dedicated capacity required?                                              |                    |
| Does it require controlled change and deployment?                                       |                    |
| Does it require expansion approval?                                                     |                    |

|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Value       | Does the service still support a useful workflow or decision cycle? |
| Usage       | Is usage meaningful, even if occasional or seasonal?                |
| Risk        | Are risks still within appetite?                                    |
| Cost        | Are run, model, support and change costs justified?                 |
| Ownership   | Are business, product and operating owners still active?            |
| Replacement | Has another tool, report, workflow or product replaced the need?    |
| Foundation  | Are data, semantic and metadata foundations still maintained?       |

## 11.2 Lifecycle action guide

| Action       | When appropriate                                                        |
