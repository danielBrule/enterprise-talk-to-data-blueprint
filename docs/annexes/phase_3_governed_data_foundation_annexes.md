# 1 How to use this annex pack

This annex pack contains example tools, templates and checklists supporting the **Phase 3 Governed Data Foundation Guide**. It is intended as practical inspiration for facilitation, documentation and delivery, not as a mandatory to-do list.

The main guide explains the delivery logic and decisions required during Phase 3. This annex provides reusable working material that teams can adapt depending on the delivery stage, business risk, data maturity, technology stack and governance requirements.

Teams should use only the templates that add value. For a narrow POC, many annex items may be simplified or skipped. For an MVP, pilot or production path, more of the material may be needed to support traceability, testing, security, cost control, ownership and operational handover.

# 2 Foundation tests, logs, cost and evidence controls

## 2.1 Testing controls

### 2.1.1 Testing principles

| Principle               | Meaning                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Test before trust       | Foundation assets should not be accepted because they build successfully; they should pass relevant tests.   |
| Automate where possible | MVP, pilot and production foundations should rely on repeatable automated checks, not manual review alone.   |
| Test by risk            | High-risk metrics, joins, security rules and executive outputs need stronger tests than low-risk POC assets. |
| Keep evidence           | Test results should be centrally stored and linked to the asset, metric, dimension or rule they validate.    |
| Re-test on change       | Changes to assets, metrics, joins, filters or security rules should trigger regression tests.                |

### 2.1.2 Test type definitions

| Metric calculation test    | Validates implemented logic against the approved formula.          | Metric implementation.                  |
| Filter / exclusion test    | Confirms mandatory filters and exclusions are applied.             | Standard filters and caveats.           |
| Reconciliation test        | Compares results against a trusted report or approved example.     | Priority metrics and financial outputs. |
| Freshness test             | Confirms data has refreshed within the expected window.            | Assets with refresh dependencies.       |

|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Log what matters      | Logs should support diagnosis, audit, cost control and operational support.                      |
| Link logs to assets   | Logs should reference the relevant asset, metric, rule, version, environment or release.         |
| Separate environments | Development, test, pilot and production logs should be distinguishable.                          |
| Alert by severity     | Not every log needs escalation; critical failures and cost spikes should notify the right owner. |
| Define retention      | Logs should be retained long enough to support audit, debugging and improvement.                 |

### 2.2.2 Log type definitions

|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Report cost by layer        | Avoid hiding foundation cost inside one platform total.                                               |
| Separate build and run cost | Initial delivery effort is different from recurring refresh, query, test and monitoring cost.         |
| Track useful units          | Use cost per refresh, query, asset, metric, question or active user where helpful.                    |
| Identify cost drivers       | Highlight expensive queries, high-frequency refreshes, large materialisations or excessive test runs. |
| Set thresholds and alerts   | Cost spikes should trigger review before they become normalised.                                      |
| Review before scaling       | POC cost patterns should inform MVP, pilot and production sizing.                                     |

# 3 Versioning and change control for foundation artefacts

Foundation artefacts should be versioned because T2D answers depend on the definitions, assets, rules and controls that were active when the answer was produced. Metrics, dimensions, joins, filters, caveats, security rules and cost thresholds may all change over time.

Versioning does not need to be heavy for a POC, but it should be explicit enough to understand what was used, what changed and who approved the change. For MVP, pilot or production, versioning should be linked to testing, deployment, ownership and rollback where appropriate.

| Field              | Description                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Version**        | Current approved version of the asset, rule or definition. |
| **Version status** | Draft, approved, deprecated or retired.                    |
| **Effective from** | Date from which this version applies.                      |
| **Effective to**   | Date until which this version applies, if known.           |
| **Last updated**   | Date of last approved change.                              |
| **Change summary** | Short description of what changed.                         |
| **Change owner**   | Person or group accountable for approving the change.      |
| **Change route**   | How updates are reviewed, tested and released.             |

Versioning should apply to both the business definition and the technical implementation. For example, a metric definition may remain stable while the SQL view changes, or a join rule may change without the business label changing. The register should make clear which version was active when an answer, test result or release was produced.

For a POC, a simple version number and change note may be enough. For MVP or pilot, changes should normally be reviewed, tested and traceable through the agreed deployment route.

# 4 Recommended register technology by delivery stage

| Stage      | Recommended register technology                                                                                      | Why                                                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| POC        | Governed spreadsheet, simple database table, or YAML/JSON files in Git                                               | Fast, low-friction, enough to size MVP effort.                 |
| MVP        | Versioned YAML/JSON, dbt metadata/semantic files, database metadata tables, or BI semantic-layer objects             | More structured, testable, reviewable and easier to integrate. |
| Pilot      | Metadata table + version-controlled definitions + catalogue/semantic-layer integration                               | Supports reuse, audit, testing and controlled change.          |
| Production | Governed catalogue / semantic layer / metadata service integrated with CI/CD, lineage, access control and monitoring | Scalable, auditable and operationally maintainable.            |

**Practical options**

| Option                            | Best use                                 | Pros                                                    | Cons                                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Governed spreadsheet**          | Early POC, workshops, business review    | Very fast, business-friendly                            | Weak automation, versioning and integration     |
| **YAML / JSON in Git**            | MVP-style engineering control            | Versioned, reviewable, machine-readable, CI/CD friendly | Less friendly for business users without a UI   |
| **Database metadata tables**      | T2D needs to query the registry directly | Queryable, easy to integrate with orchestration         | Needs update process and ownership              |
| **dbt metadata / semantic layer** | dbt already used for transformations     | Links definitions, tests, lineage and deployment        | May not cover all business-facing context       |
| **BI semantic layer**             | Existing BI definitions are trusted      | Reuses approved metrics and dimensions                  | Tool-specific; may be hard to expose safely     |
| **Data catalogue**                | Enterprise governance and ownership      | Good for lineage, stewardship, discoverability          | Often not structured enough for runtime T2D use |
| **Metadata API/service**          | Mature production environment            | Controlled, auditable, scalable                         | Higher build and operating effort               |

### 5.1.4 Final scope check

Before build starts, the team should be able to answer:

- What exactly is being implemented now?

- Which Phase 2-approved questions does it support?

- Which sources and metrics are excluded?

- What caveats must be visible to users or evaluators?

- Who owns each source, metric, caveat and exclusion?

- What new risks were discovered during build-scope confirmation?

| Definition of done | Asset is implemented, tested, documented, owned, versioned and ready for downstream build/evaluation.                       |

### 5.2.2 Example technology routes

| Route                         | Example                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View-led foundation           | Curated SQL views in Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks or Redshift.                            |
| Transformation-led foundation | dbt or platform-native pipelines creating tested models.                                     |
| Semantic-layer-led foundation | Looker, Cube, MetricFlow, Power BI semantic model or similar.                                |
| API-led foundation            | Controlled service endpoints for approved metrics or sensitive queries.                      |
| Hybrid foundation             | dbt models plus semantic-layer definitions plus materialised tables for high-volume queries. |

### 5.2.3 Implementation patterns

| Term                   | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Curated views          | Governed database views that expose approved columns, joins, filters or calculations for T2D use, without giving the assistant direct access to raw source tables.                                     |
| Transformation models  | Engineered data models, often built with tools such as dbt or platform-native pipelines, that transform raw or intermediate data into tested, documented and reusable analytical structures.           |
| Semantic-layer objects | Governed business-facing definitions of metrics, dimensions, relationships, hierarchies and filters that allow the same business logic to be reused consistently across T2D, BI and analytics tools.   |
| Materialised tables    | Precomputed physical tables created to improve performance, reduce query cost or stabilise complex logic that would be too slow, expensive or fragile to calculate dynamically.                        |
| Controlled APIs        | Approved service endpoints that expose specific data or calculations through managed logic, permissions and audit controls, rather than allowing open-ended SQL access.                                |
| Hybrid pattern         | A combined foundation approach using more than one pattern, such as semantic-layer definitions over curated views, or APIs for sensitive calculations and materialised tables for high-volume metrics. |

### 5.2.4 Pattern comparison

| Pattern                | Typical use                       | Strengths                                    | Trade-offs                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Curated views          | Fast governed query surface       | Simple, transparent, quick to build          | Can become hard to manage at scale       |
| Transformation models  | Tested reusable data models       | Versioned, documented, CI/CD-friendly        | Requires engineering discipline          |
| Semantic-layer objects | Consistent metrics and dimensions | Reusable across BI, analytics and T2D        | Depends on tooling maturity and adoption |
| Materialised tables    | Performance and cost control      | Fast, stable, predictable queries            | Adds storage and refresh management      |
| Controlled APIs        | Sensitive or constrained logic    | Strong control, auditability and permissions | Less flexible for exploration            |
| Hybrid pattern         | Mixed enterprise environments     | Pragmatic and adaptable                      | Needs clear ownership and standards      |

### 5.2.5 Technology decision checklist

| Decision area       | Key question                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| Transformation tool | How will models, views or tables be built?            |
| Semantic layer      | Where will metrics and dimensions be defined?         |
| Access control      | Where will row, column and masking rules be enforced? |
| Testing approach    | How will logic, quality and regressions be tested?    |
| Deployment approach | How will changes be reviewed and released?            |
| Monitoring          | How will freshness, failures and cost be tracked?     |
| Ownership           | Who owns the platform and foundation assets?          |

### 5.4.3 Example implementation logic

Below is a simplified example of how the metric might be implemented in a curated SQL view or transformation model.

```sql
SELECT
    order_line_id,
    order_id,
    order_date,
    region,
    product_category,
    customer_segment,
    sales_channel,
    gross_revenue,
    discount_amount,
    refund_amount,
    gross_revenue - discount_amount - refund_amount AS net_revenue
FROM sales_order_line
WHERE order_status = 'completed'
  AND is_test_order = false;
```

For T2D, the assistant should query the implemented net_revenue field or approved metric object. It should not recreate the calculation from memory or infer exclusions from the user’s wording.

|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governed spreadsheet               | Metric registry maintained in a controlled spreadsheet.                      | Fast to start; accessible to business users; suitable for POC.                     | Weak versioning; harder to automate; can become unreliable at scale.                |
| Data catalogue entry               | Metrics documented in a catalogue or metadata management tool.               | Good discoverability; supports ownership and lineage; familiar governance pattern. | May not be easy for the T2D system to query directly; depends on catalogue quality. |
| YAML / JSON files                  | Metric definitions stored as structured files in version control.            | Versioned, reviewable, machine-readable; good for CI/CD and retrieval.             | Less business-friendly unless supported by a UI or documentation layer.             |
| dbt semantic layer / metrics layer | Metrics defined in dbt or similar transformation framework.                  | Strong link between definition, transformation, testing and lineage.               | Requires engineering maturity; may not cover all business documentation needs.      |
| BI semantic layer                  | Metrics defined in tools such as Looker, Power BI semantic model or similar. | Reuses existing BI definitions; aligns reporting and T2D.                          | Tool-specific constraints; may be hard to expose safely to the assistant.           |
| Custom metadata table              | Registry stored in a governed database table.                                | Queryable by T2D; easy to integrate with orchestration and retrieval.              | Requires ownership, UI or process for updates.                                      |
| API-backed registry                | Metrics exposed through an approved metadata or metric API.                  | Strong control, auditability and integration.                                      | More engineering effort; usually too heavy for early POC.                           |

#### 5.4.5.4 Recommended approach by delivery stage

| Delivery stage | Recommended approach                                                                                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| POC            | Governed spreadsheet, simple metadata table or YAML file with clear ownership.                                          |
| MVP            | Versioned YAML / JSON, metadata table, dbt metrics or BI semantic-layer integration.                                    |
| Pilot          | Registry linked to implemented logic, testing, ownership and change control.                                            |
| Production     | Governed, versioned, auditable registry integrated with catalogue, semantic layer, CI/CD and monitoring where possible. |

#### 5.4.5.5 Minimum registry checks

Before a metric is made available to T2D, confirm:

- The approved metric name and definition are clear.

- The implementation reference exists and is queryable.

- Mandatory filters, date logic and caveats are explicit.

- Allowed dimensions are defined.

- Synonyms are mapped or marked as ambiguous.

- The owner and operational contact are named.

- Validation evidence exists or the limitation is explicit.

- The metric status is clear: approved, caveated, deferred, deprecated or excluded.

- The entry is usable by the assistant for routing, grounding or explanation.

| Aggregation reconciliation test | Confirms totals remain correct after grouping. | Revenue by region sums to total revenue.                                    |
| Minimum group test              | Confirms small groups are suppressed.          | No result returned for groups below threshold.                              |
| Security join test              | Confirms access rules survive joins.           | User restricted to Region A cannot infer Region B after joining dimensions. |

### 5.6.6 Minimum checks before approval

Before a join, grain or aggregation rule is approved for T2D use, confirm:

- The grain of each asset is explicit.

- The join path is approved and documented.

- The relationship type is known.

- Many-to-many joins are controlled or excluded.

- Aggregation behaviour is valid for the metric.

- Disallowed metric-dimension combinations are documented.

- Security and inference implications are identified.

- Automated tests exist where appropriate.

- Owner and operational contact are named.

- Caveats and limitations are available to the assistant where relevant.

| Change route        | Reviewed by Finance Analytics during month-end process updates.                |

### 5.7.5 Common clarification patterns

Clarification rules cannot be exhaustive. The aim is to define common ambiguity patterns and default behaviours, not to anticipate every possible user question. For MVP or pilot, the team should monitor real user questions, review ambiguous cases and update the filter, caveat and clarification rules over time.

| User question                      | Issue                                      | Assistant behaviour                                                             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Show revenue for last period.”    | “Last period” is ambiguous.                | Ask whether the user means last week, month, quarter or financial period.       |
| “Show active customers.”           | Active customer definition may vary.       | Use approved definition if available; otherwise ask clarification.              |
| “Compare sales by region.”         | Region hierarchy may have multiple levels. | Use default approved hierarchy or ask if market, country or region is intended. |
| “Show revenue for this month.”     | Current month is provisional.              | Answer with current-month caveat.                                               |
| “Show customers with low revenue.” | Potentially exposes customer-level detail. | Check security rules and aggregation thresholds before answering.               |

### 5.7.6 Automated test examples

| Test                         | Purpose                                                 | Example                                                                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mandatory filter test        | Confirms required exclusions are applied.               | Cancelled orders are excluded from net revenue.                                        |
| Default filter test          | Confirms default filters are applied consistently.      | Current active products only are included unless user asks for historical product set. |
| Date logic test              | Confirms the correct date field is used.                | Sales reporting uses order_date, not invoice_date.                                     |
| Caveat trigger test          | Confirms caveats appear when conditions are met.        | Current-month revenue triggers provisional-period caveat.                              |
| Clarification test           | Confirms ambiguous terms trigger clarification.         | “Last period” asks for period clarification.                                           |
| Cross-asset consistency test | Confirms same rule is applied across assets.            | Test orders are excluded from all sales metrics.                                       |
| Regression test              | Confirms filter behaviour does not change unexpectedly. | Existing priority questions still apply approved exclusions after release.             |

### 5.7.7 Minimum checks before approval

Before a filter or caveat is made available to T2D, confirm:

- The business purpose is clear.

- The technical logic is implemented or available to the assistant.

- The assets, metrics, dimensions or questions it applies to are known.

- Default behaviour is defined.

- User-facing wording is approved where needed.

- Clarification rules are defined for ambiguous cases.

- Validation evidence exists or the limitation is explicit.

- Owner and operational contact are named.

- Version and change route are defined.

- Automated tests exist where appropriate.

|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| User group mapping test    | Confirms users are assigned to the correct access group.                            | Regional manager maps to the correct current region.           |
| Master-data alignment test | Confirms access mappings use the approved user, organisation or territory master.   | User’s region matches sales territory master.                  |
| Role-based access test     | Confirms users only see permitted scope.                                            | Regional manager can see Region A but not Region B.            |
| Column restriction test    | Confirms restricted fields are not exposed.                                         | Customer email is unavailable to the assistant.                |
| Masking test               | Confirms sensitive values are masked correctly.                                     | Account ID is masked for non-approved users.                   |
| Aggregation threshold test | Confirms small groups are suppressed.                                               | No result returned for customer groups below threshold.        |
| Join security test         | Confirms access rules survive joins.                                                | Joining region hierarchy does not expose unauthorised regions. |
| Metadata access test       | Confirms restricted definitions or caveats are not retrieved by unauthorised users. | Restricted finance caveat is not shown to commercial users.    |
| Repeated-query test        | Checks whether users can infer sensitive values through follow-up questions.        | Overlapping filters do not reveal single-customer values.      |
| Audit log test             | Confirms sensitive access events are logged.                                        | Denied access and suppressed results are recorded.             |

### 5.8.4 Minimum checks before approval

Before a security or exposure control is approved for T2D use, confirm:

- User groups or roles are defined and linked to existing enterprise identity or master-data structures where possible.

- Sensitive assets, fields, dimensions, joins and metrics are identified.

- Row-level, column-level, masking and aggregation rules are implemented where required.

- Small-group and inference risks are considered.

- Security controls are tested with representative user roles.

- Denied, masked and suppressed outputs behave as expected.

- Audit and logging requirements are defined.

- Residual risks are documented and approved for the delivery stage.

- Owner, operational contact and change route are named.

- Version and effective date are recorded.

- Open security assumptions are handed over to security and governance validation.

### 5.9.4 Cost reporting by meaningful layer

Cost reporting should separate infrastructure consumption from support effort. This avoids hiding the true cost of the governed foundation inside one platform total.

| Cost layer             | Cost type      | What to track                                                                                               |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storage                | Infrastructure | Storage volume, growth rate, retained history, duplicated data, materialised tables.                        |
| Ingestion              | Infrastructure | Source extraction cost, data movement cost, API calls, batch frequency, streaming cost.                     |
| Transformation         | Infrastructure | Compute used by transformations, model builds, incremental loads, backfills, failed or retried jobs.        |
| Materialisation        | Infrastructure | Storage and refresh cost of materialised tables, aggregates or cached outputs.                              |
| Query execution        | Infrastructure | Query volume, query duration, scanned data, high-cost queries, concurrency, warehouse size.                 |
| Automated testing      | Infrastructure | Cost of CI/CD tests, reconciliation checks, regression tests and validation jobs.                           |
| Monitoring and logging | Infrastructure | Log storage, metric collection, alerting, observability platform cost and retention cost.                   |
| Security and audit     | Mixed          | Audit log retention, policy enforcement overhead, access review effort.                                     |
| T2D usage              | Mixed          | User questions, tool calls, generated queries, retries, failed queries, model/API costs where relevant.     |
| Support and operations | Support        | Incident handling, access requests, metric changes, caveat updates, quality remediation, owner review time. |

| Question                                                   | Answer                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Is the governed foundation fit for the intended next step? | Yes / No / Yes with caveats         |
| What delivery stage is it fit for?                         | POC / MVP / pilot / production path |
| What is not yet fit for broader use?                       |                                     |
| What risks remain?                                         |                                     |
| What must be remediated before scaling?                    |                                     |
| Who owns the next decision?                                |                                     |
| Date of handover decision                                  |                                     |

This final decision should be short and explicit. The goal is not to prove that the full T2D product is ready, but to confirm whether the governed foundation is controlled, understood and usable for the next delivery stage.
