# 1 How to use this annex

These annexes provide optional working templates for **Phase 8: Production readiness and controlled release**. They are intended to help teams convert pilot evidence into a controlled production release decision, not to create a mandatory checklist or a parallel delivery methodology.

The main Phase 8 guide explains the release logic: what can go live, what must be fixed before release, what constraints apply, who owns the capability, what risks are accepted, what budget and support capacity are required, and how the capability should move into Phase 9 operation, adoption and improvement.

This annex provides reusable working material for that process. Teams should select only the templates that match the delivery intent, risk level, organisational maturity and production exposure of the release.

For a narrow controlled release, some templates may be lightweight. For a higher-risk release, broader user exposure, sensitive data, regulated use cases or executive decision support, the evidence, sign-off, support, monitoring, risk acceptance and cost material should be treated more formally.

The annexes are especially useful for:

- classifying issues from the pilot and deciding which must be fixed before release;

- defining the final production release boundary;

- tracking pre-release hardening, fixes and regression evidence;

- confirming production controls, monitoring and operational readiness;

- preparing support, documentation, onboarding and escalation material;

- sizing support, bug-fix, improvement and roadmap capacity;

- recording release approval, residual-risk acceptance and Phase 9 handover.

The templates should be adapted, not copied mechanically. A team should be able to explain why each selected artefact is needed for the release decision. If a template does not help decide, support, control or operate the production release, it should be simplified or skipped.

The central test for Phase 8 documentation is practical: can users understand what they can rely on, can support teams diagnose and respond to issues, can owners fund and govern the capability, and can decision-makers defend the release boundary and residual risks.

## 2.2 Boundary-to-evidence mapping

| Release item              | Included? | Phase 7 evidence                                      | Production concern                                   | Decision                             |
|---------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Regional sales managers   | Yes       | High usage, repeated workflow fit, few support issues | Needs onboarding and clear limitation guidance       | Include                              |
| Revenue by region         | Yes       | Frequently used, trusted, low issue rate              | Current-month data caveat required                   | Include with caveat                  |
| Margin by product         | No        | High demand but inconsistent interpretation           | Metric definition not production-ready               | Exclude / roadmap                    |
| Customer-level drill-down | Limited   | Useful but raised access concerns                     | Requires stricter access checks                      | Include for analysts only            |
| Forecasting questions     | No        | Users requested it, but not tested                    | Unsupported answer type and high interpretation risk | Exclude                              |
| Executive summary answers | Limited   | Valued by pilot users                                 | Risk of overstatement                                | Include only with source and caveats |

## 2.3 Suggested release boundary statuses

| Status                  | Meaning                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Include                 | Supported by evidence and ready for controlled production release.       |
| Include with caveat     | Usable in production only with visible limitation or usage condition.    |
| Include with constraint | Usable only for defined users, domains, volumes or support conditions.   |
| Fix before inclusion    | Valuable but requires Phase 8 hardening before release.                  |
| Monitor after release   | Acceptable only with threshold, owner and response route.                |
| Exclude from release    | Not safe or mature enough for first production release.                  |
| Move to Phase 9 roadmap | Useful future candidate, but not needed for first release.               |
| Return to earlier phase | Requires renewed data, semantic, architecture, validation or pilot work. |

## 2.4 Illustrative example: controlled production boundary

Example — illustrative

| Area                        | Decision                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Release objective           | Enable regional sales managers to ask governed questions on revenue performance.     |
| Target users                | 20 regional sales managers and 3 sales operations analysts.                          |
| Excluded users              | Finance, executives, account executives and external users.                          |
| Data domains                | Sales revenue and pipeline summary.                                                  |
| Data assets                 | sales_revenue_mart, region_dimension, pipeline_summary_view.                         |
| Metrics                     | Net revenue, customer count, pipeline conversion.                                    |
| Excluded metrics            | Margin, profitability, forecast revenue, salesperson performance.                    |
| Question types              | KPI lookup, trend, comparison, variance by region or segment.                        |
| Answer types                | Number, table, short narrative, caveated answer, clarification and refusal.          |
| Follow-up behaviour         | Follow-ups allowed within same domain and approved dimensions.                       |
| Known limitations           | Current-month revenue is provisional; pipeline refresh is daily, not real time.      |
| Release constraints         | No customer-level profitability, no forecasting, no individual performance analysis. |
| Cost / capacity implication | Expected 100–150 questions per week; daily support review for first two weeks.       |
| Owner                       | Sales operations product owner.                                                      |

## 2.5 Scope challenge questions

Use these questions before approving the release boundary:

- Is each included question type supported by Phase 7 evidence?

- Is the release scope smaller than or equal to the evidence-proven pilot boundary?

- Are any items included mainly because users requested them?

- Are all included metrics approved, owned and explainable?

- Are all included joins, filters, caveats and dimensions safe for production use?

- Can support teams explain what is in and out of scope?

- Can users understand the limitations without reading a technical document?

- Would the release still be safe if usage doubled?

- Does the proposed scope create additional cost, monitoring or support needs?

- Is there a named owner for every included domain, metric and release constraint?

## 2.6 Common boundary mistakes

| Mistake                                        | Why it matters                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Including everything that worked once in pilot | One successful interaction is not production evidence.                                        |
| Letting user demand define production scope    | Demand proves interest, not readiness.                                                        |
| Treating caveats as a substitute for controls  | Caveats do not fix weak semantics, unsafe joins or missing ownership.                         |
| Expanding to senior users too early            | Decision impact and reputational risk increase sharply.                                       |
| Including unsupported follow-ups               | Multi-turn behaviour can silently expand scope.                                               |
| Forgetting support impact                      | A broader boundary creates more incidents, questions and interpretation support.              |
| Ignoring cost impact                           | More users and broader question types can increase model, query, monitoring and support cost. |

## 2.7 Evidence to retain

- Approved production release boundary.

- In-scope and out-of-scope list.

- Boundary-to-evidence mapping.

- Known limitations and release constraints.

- Data, semantic and access owners for included scope.

- Cost and capacity assumptions.

- Decision record approving or rejecting the proposed boundary.

## 3.2 Issue disposition guide

| Disposition            | Use when                                                                                             | Release implication                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Production blocker     | The issue makes production unsafe, ungoverned or unsupportable.                                      | Fix before release, narrow, redesign or stop.       |
| Pre-release fix        | The issue is fixable and required before controlled release.                                         | Add to Phase 8 hardening backlog.                   |
| Release constraint     | The issue can be managed by limiting users, scope, question types, volume or support conditions.     | Release only with explicit constraint.              |
| Accepted residual risk | The issue is known, understood and accepted by the accountable owner.                                | Record rationale, owner and review condition.       |
| Monitored risk         | The issue is acceptable only if actively watched.                                                    | Add monitoring threshold, owner and response route. |
| Phase 9 backlog        | The issue is not required for first release but should be improved after go-live.                    | Add to run / fix / improve backlog.                 |
| Later enhancement      | The item is valuable but outside release readiness.                                                  | Add to roadmap, not release decision.               |
| Redesign / stop signal | The issue exposes structural weakness in data, semantics, architecture, controls or operating model. | Return to earlier phase, redesign, pause or stop.   |

## 3.3 Priority assessment matrix

Issue priority should not be based on technical severity alone.

| Dimension                | Low                              | Medium                                       | High                                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User impact              | Few users, workaround available. | Multiple users or repeated friction.         | Critical user group or no practical workaround.                     |
| Decision impact          | Informational only.              | Supports operational or tactical decision.   | Supports senior, financial, regulatory or high-visibility decision. |
| Trust impact             | Annoying but explainable.        | Could create hesitation or confusion.        | Could damage confidence in the whole release.                       |
| Access / security impact | No exposure risk.                | Permission ambiguity or unclear audit trail. | Data exposure, bypass risk or unauthorised access.                  |
| Support impact           | Easy to explain or resolve.      | Requires specialist support.                 | Likely to create repeated incidents or escalation.                  |
| Cost impact              | Negligible.                      | Noticeable but manageable.                   | Could exceed budget, monitoring or support capacity.                |
| Visibility               | Internal delivery team.          | Business users.                              | Executive, audit, regulator or external stakeholder.                |

| Wrong caveat missing from executive revenue answer     | Medium             | High                | Could lead senior users to over-trust provisional numbers. | Pre-release fix                        |
| Popular request for margin analysis                    | Not a defect       | Medium              | Strong demand, but metric not production-ready.            | Exclude / roadmap                      |
| Access removal takes three days                        | Medium             | High                | Weak access lifecycle for production users.                | Pre-release fix or release constraint  |
| High-cost query triggered by broad follow-up           | Medium             | High                | Could create cost spikes and performance issues.           | Fix / monitor / constrain              |
| Minor typo in onboarding guide                         | Low                | Low                 | Does not affect safe use.                                  | Fix if easy, otherwise Phase 9 backlog |
| Users repeatedly ask unsupported forecasting questions | Not a defect       | Medium              | Scope misunderstanding may create trust risk.              | Onboarding update and refusal rule     |
| SQL generation fails for a supported metric            | High               | High                | Supported production question cannot be relied on.         | Production blocker                     |

## 3.5 Pre-release hardening backlog template

| Fix ID  | Issue linked | Required fix                                         | Owner                 | Priority | Effort | Regression required       | Release dependency         | Status |

|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| No forecasting questions              | Not validated and high interpretation risk | All users                 | Product owner  | Yes                        | Unsupported-question rate | Phase 9 roadmap review |
| Customer drill-down only for analysts | Access and interpretation risk             | Sales operations analysts | Data owner     | Yes                        | Access logs               | After access review    |
| Usage cap of 150 questions / week     | Cost and support capacity                  | First release cohort      | Platform owner | Yes                        | Cost dashboard            | After four weeks       |

## 3.7 Residual-risk candidate template

| Risk                                                | Why not fixed before release?                          | Release condition                                 | Accountable owner  | Monitoring / control           | Review date             |

## 3.8 Triage meeting agenda

- Confirm release boundary under consideration.

- Review new and open Phase 7 findings.

- Classify each material issue by disposition.

- Identify production blockers and pre-release fixes.

- Confirm release constraints and monitored risks.

- Separate Phase 9 backlog items from later enhancements.

- Review cost, support and capacity implications.

- Confirm owners, evidence required and decision dates.

- Escalate structural blockers or unresolved risk acceptances.

- Update the release recommendation.

## 3.9 Common triage mistakes

| Mistake                                        | Why it matters                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Treating all bugs by technical severity        | Business impact depends on user, workflow, decision and visibility.                                   |
| Hiding issues in a generic backlog             | Release decisions require disposition, ownership and conditions.                                      |
| Accepting fixes without regression evidence    | A fix can change model behaviour, prompts, SQL or answer interpretation.                              |
| Treating user requests as release requirements | Demand proves interest, not readiness.                                                                |
| Deferring support issues to Phase 9            | Support gaps become production incidents once users rely on the system.                               |
| Ignoring executive visibility                  | A small defect in a senior workflow can damage trust more than a larger issue in a low-risk workflow. |
| Assuming all residual risks are equal          | Residual risk must be accepted by the right owner, not just noted by the project team.                |

|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Add current-month caveat to revenue answers          | Without the caveat, users may over-trust provisional numbers.   | Run revenue questions across month-to-date, prior month and trend examples. Confirm caveat appears where required. | Required before release    |
| Tighten follow-up limits for broad questions         | Broad follow-ups may trigger expensive or slow queries.         | Test broad follow-ups, unsupported filters and high-volume queries. Confirm refusal, clarification or cap.         | Required before release    |

## 4.8 Hardening cut-off rule

Before starting hardening, agree a cut-off rule to prevent Phase 8 becoming an open-ended improvement loop.

Suggested rule:

| Category            | Treatment after cut-off                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Production blocker  | Must be fixed, or release is delayed / narrowed / stopped.          |
| Pre-release fix     | Must be fixed unless formally reclassified.                         |
| Release constraint  | Can remain only if reflected in release boundary and user guidance. |
| Monitored risk      | Can remain only with threshold, owner and response route.           |
| Phase 9 improvement | Deferred to Phase 9 backlog.                                        |
| Later enhancement   | Deferred to roadmap.                                                |

## 4.9 Common hardening mistakes

| Mistake                                  | Why it matters                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixing without regression                | The fix may break another supported question, control or user flow.                |
| Treating prompt changes as low risk      | Prompt changes can alter answer style, caveats, refusals, SQL and trust behaviour. |
| Reassigning the delivery team too early  | Critical fixes may be delayed or handled by people without system context.         |
| Adding enhancements during hardening     | The release target keeps moving and regression scope expands.                      |
| Updating behaviour without release notes | Users and support teams cannot explain changed behaviour.                          |
| Deferring support fixes to Phase 9       | Support gaps become live incidents after release.                                  |
| Ignoring cost impact of fixes            | A safer fix may increase latency, model usage, monitoring or support effort.       |

## 4.10 Evidence to retain

- Pre-release hardening backlog.

- Fix evidence and linked issue IDs.

- Regression test results.

- Behaviour-change and control-change record.

- Updated release notes and known limitations.

- Updated runbooks, onboarding material or support guidance.

## 5.6 Illustrative example: production control gap

| Finding                                                                 | Release implication                                    | Response                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Revenue metric approved, but current-month refresh can lag by 24 hours. | Release possible with caveat and freshness monitoring. | Display current-month caveat, add freshness alert, review after first month. |
| Customer drill-down works technically but access review is incomplete.  | Cannot release to all users.                           | Restrict to sales operations analysts until access review is complete.       |
| Audit logs record the answer but not retrieved metadata.                | Weak traceability for support and governance.          | Fix before release or constrain use to lower-risk questions.                 |
| Metric owner has approved pilot use but not production use.             | Ownership gap.                                         | Obtain production approval or exclude metric from release.                   |
| Revocation process is manual and untested.                              | Production access lifecycle risk.                      | Test revocation before release and assign owner / SLA.                       |

## 5.7 Control readiness status guide

| Status                | Meaning                                                             | Release implication                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Ready                 | Control is approved, enforceable and owned.                         | Release can proceed for this area.                |
| Ready with caveat     | Control is acceptable with visible limitation or monitoring.        | Release with condition.                           |
| Ready with constraint | Control works only for specific users, domains or usage levels.     | Constrain release boundary.                       |
| Fix before release    | Control gap is material but fixable.                                | Add to hardening backlog.                         |
| Accept residual risk  | Control gap remains but is knowingly accepted by accountable owner. | Record risk acceptance and review date.           |
| Not ready             | Control gap makes release unsafe or ungoverned.                     | Exclude, narrow, return to earlier phase or stop. |

## 5.8 Common control-readiness mistakes

| Mistake                                    | Why it matters                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Treating pilot access as production access | Pilot access is often manually managed and not lifecycle-ready.                        |
| Approving data without refresh rules       | Users may rely on stale or provisional data without knowing it.                        |
| Assuming caveats solve control gaps        | Caveats help interpretation; they do not replace access, quality or semantic controls. |
| Missing owner sign-off                     | Production controls need accountable owners after the project team leaves.             |
| Logging too little context                 | Support cannot diagnose issues without query, metadata, answer and access traces.      |
| Making controls manual without capacity    | Manual controls fail unless owned, scheduled, monitored and funded.                    |
| Forgetting cost of controls                | Monitoring, audit retention, access management and quality checks all create run cost. |

|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitoring only infrastructure              | T2D failures often sit in semantics, retrieval, caveats, access or interpretation.        |
| No named alert owner                        | Alerts without owners become noise.                                                       |
| Cost review after month-end only            | Cost spikes can occur quickly with broad questions, expensive models or repeated retries. |
| Logs not linked to user feedback            | Support cannot diagnose what happened.                                                    |
| No pause trigger                            | Teams hesitate during incidents because nobody knows when to stop the release.            |
| Dashboards built for the delivery team only | Support, product and owners need operational views they can act on.                       |
| Missing unsupported-question tracking       | Repeated unsupported demand is often the first signal that scope or onboarding is weak.   |

|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unsupported question              | “This question is not supported in the current release. The release currently supports revenue and pipeline questions by region and segment, but not forecasting or margin analysis.” |
| Known data freshness caveat       | “This answer uses daily refreshed pipeline data. Same-day CRM updates may not be reflected.”                                                                                          |

## 7.9 Documentation ownership plan

| Document                 | Owner                      | Review cadence               | Update trigger                                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| User guide               | Product owner              | Monthly during early life    | Scope change, user confusion, new limitation.    |
| Known limitations        | Product / data owner       | Weekly during first month    | New caveat, data issue, release constraint.      |

## 7.10 Common documentation and onboarding mistakes

| Mistake                                      | Why it matters                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Treating documentation as user guidance only | Support, governance, product and platform teams also need release-ready documentation. |
| Reusing pilot material unchanged             | Pilot documents may not reflect final fixes, constraints or production ownership.      |
| Hiding limitations in technical language     | Users need plain-language boundaries to avoid over-reliance.                           |
| No support route in user material            | Users will escalate informally or stop trusting the system.                            |
| No release notes for behaviour changes       | Users and support teams cannot explain why answers changed.                            |
| No documentation owner                       | Documentation becomes stale as soon as Phase 9 begins.                                 |
| Onboarding too broad                         | Users may assume the system supports more than the controlled release boundary.        |

## 7.11 Evidence to retain

- Production documentation readiness summary.

- User onboarding material.

- Release notes and behaviour-change record.

- Known limitations and responsible-use guidance.

- Support runbook and escalation route.

- Controlled adoption readiness plan.

- Documentation ownership and maintenance plan.

- Evidence that users and support teams were onboarded before access.

## 8.8 Common operating-model and budget mistakes

| Mistake                                        | Why it matters                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Treating model cost as the whole cost          | People, monitoring, support, testing, data refresh and governance often cost more than inference. |
| Assuming the delivery team will stay available | Teams often move on before hardening, early-life support and roadmap work are complete.           |
| Funding release but not support                | Users get access, but no one owns issues after go-live.                                           |
| Mixing fixes and enhancements                  | Release-critical defects compete with nice-to-have roadmap items.                                 |
| Expanding before stabilising                   | New users and domains multiply support, cost and trust risks.                                     |
| Ignoring data and semantic capacity            | T2D roadmap expansion usually depends on data and semantic work, not only engineering.            |
| No cost trigger                                | Teams discover cost pressure only after the budget is already exceeded.                           |

## 9.8 Post-release review criteria

| Area        | Review question                                                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Usage       | Are the right users using the system at the expected level?          |
| Trust       | Are users relying on the answers appropriately?                      |
| Quality     | Are supported questions answered correctly and consistently?         |
| Scope       | Are users repeatedly asking out-of-scope questions?                  |
| Support     | Is support demand manageable?                                        |
| Cost        | Is usage within budget and cost thresholds?                          |
| Reliability | Are latency, failures and incidents within agreed thresholds?        |
| Controls    | Are access, audit, data and semantic controls holding in production? |
| Roadmap     | Should Phase 9 focus on run, fix, improve or expand?                 |

## 9.9 Expansion criteria

- Before adding users, domains, question types or integrations, confirm:

- the first production release is stable enough to absorb more usage;

- known production defects are not blocking trust or support;

- data and semantic readiness exists for the proposed expansion;

- access, security and audit controls can support the wider scope;

- monitoring and cost thresholds can handle additional volume;

- support and onboarding capacity is available;

- residual risks are reviewed and accepted by the right owners;

- the expansion is funded and prioritised against run, fix and improve work.

## 9.10 Common release approval mistakes

| Mistake                             | Why it matters                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Treating release as a ceremony      | The decision must record scope, risks, owners and conditions.                       |
| Accepting residual risk informally  | Risk acceptance needs accountable ownership, not project-team acknowledgement.      |
| Releasing before support is live    | Users will escalate informally or lose trust.                                       |
| No pause authority                  | Teams hesitate during incidents because nobody can stop or narrow the release.      |
| Handover without budget             | Phase 9 starts with responsibility but no capacity.                                 |
| Expanding immediately after go-live | Early demand can hide unresolved support, cost or control issues.                   |
| Losing the release boundary         | Users and stakeholders start treating a controlled release as general availability. |
