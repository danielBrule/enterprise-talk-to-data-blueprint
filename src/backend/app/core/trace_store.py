class TraceStore:
    """
    Appends pipeline TraceRecords to a JSONL file after every run (answered or refused).

    Designed as a single-method interface so the storage backend can be swapped
    without touching the pipeline. Only _write() needs to change.

    Current backend — local JSONL file:
      Sufficient for a demo or single-instance deployment. Zero infrastructure
      overhead; human-readable; easy to ingest into any downstream tool.

    Production backend options (Azure):
      - Azure SQL INSERT into a pipeline_traces table (same DB already used for
        analytics — natural home for query-level telemetry, easy to join with
        view-level metrics, queryable with standard SQL for pass-rate trends and
        refusal analysis).
      - Application Insights custom event (recommended for real-time operational
        monitoring: latency alerts, cost spike detection, error-rate dashboards).
        Complementary to SQL, not a replacement — ops teams use App Insights,
        data/product teams use SQL.
      Both patterns share this interface; only _write() changes.

    See PRODUCTION_PRACTICES.md §Observability for the full rationale.
