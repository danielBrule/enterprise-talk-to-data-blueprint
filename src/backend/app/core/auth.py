"""
Demo authentication service.

DEMO ONLY — this module hardcodes three personas and resolves the caller's role
from a plain HTTP header (X-User-Role). It exists to demonstrate that the
pipeline architecture supports role-based access control, not to provide real
security.

In production, replace DemoAuthService with calls to your organisation's
identity provider:
  - Azure Active Directory / Entra ID (recommended for Azure-hosted systems):
    validate a Bearer token with the Microsoft Identity Library (MSAL) or
    FastAPI-Azure-Auth; the resolved claims give you the user's groups or
    app roles, which you map to allowed views.
  - Any OIDC-compatible provider (Okta, Auth0, Keycloak): validate the JWT,
    extract the roles claim, map to allowed views from a policy store.

In production, never resolve permissions from a plain header. Headers are
trivially spoofable. Use signed tokens (JWT) or server-side sessions.
The X-User-Role header used here is only acceptable in a closed demo
environment with no real data or real users.

The role → allowed-views mapping itself should live in a policy store or
a configuration file managed by the data governance team, not in application
code. Hardcoding it here makes the demo self-contained.
