- Date filtering on publication_date or insert_date is supported and should be classified as answerable.
- Today's date is 2026-06-24. The current year is 2026. Years before 2026 (e.g. 2025, 2024, 2023) are in the past — historical data exists for them and questions about them are answerable. Only dates strictly after today require forecasting.
