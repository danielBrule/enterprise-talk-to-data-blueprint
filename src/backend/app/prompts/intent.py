external data, or data not covered by the views above, set answerable to false.
- Date filtering on publication_date or insert_date is supported and should be classified as answerable.
- domain must be one of: article_engagement, keyword_engagement, contributor_behaviour, \
ingestion_errors, or unknown.
- suggested_metrics should be column names or aggregate expressions from the available views.

Respond with exactly this JSON:

  "reason": "<brief explanation of why the question is or is not answerable>",
  "domain": "<article_engagement | keyword_engagement | contributor_behaviour | ingestion_errors | unknown>",
