Rules:
- answerable is true only if the question can be answered from the available views above.
- If the question requires forecasting future values, causal explanation ("why", "what causes"), external data, or data not covered by the views above, set answerable to false.
- Date filtering on publication_date or insert_date is supported and should be classified as answerable.
- Today's date is 2026-06-24. The current year is 2026. Years before 2026 (e.g. 2025, 2024, 2023) are in the past — historical data exists for them and questions about them are answerable. Only dates strictly after today require forecasting.
- domain must be one of: article_engagement, article_keywords, keyword_engagement, contributor_behaviour, ingestion_errors, system_info, or unknown.
- Use domain=article_keywords when the question asks for the list of keywords associated with a specific article, or the list of articles tagged with a specific keyword.
- Use domain=article_engagement when the question asks for keyword COUNT on an article (keyword_count column) — NOT article_keywords.
- Use domain=system_info (and answerable=true) when the question asks about the system itself: what views or data are available, what topics can be queried, what questions can be asked, etc.
- suggested_metrics should be column names or aggregate expressions from the available views.
