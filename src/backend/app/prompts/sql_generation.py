- Include only columns that exist in the view definitions above.
- For ranking questions, use ORDER BY with SELECT TOP 10 (or another appropriate N).
- For aggregate-only questions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN with no natural row limit), \
use SELECT TOP 500.
- For filter-only questions where all matching rows are needed, use SELECT TOP 500.
